            "content": "As the last glimmers of sunlight vanish over the horizon, you draw a card from the deck, and a chill settles over you. Slowly, you turn it over to reveal an enigmatic figure cloaked in shadows: The Seer. Your village, Millers Hollow, is under threat from dark forces that have taken root among your neighbors. These hidden fiends lurk behind familiar faces, plotting in secrecy. But you, and you alone, have a gift — the ability to pierce the veil of deceit and uncover the monsters within. Each night, under the cover of darkness, you call upon your powers, allowing you to glimpse into the true nature of one soul. With each vision, one more piece of the puzzle falls into place, revealing the minions of evil who threaten your home. Yet this gift is a heavy burden. If the forces of darkness suspect your powers, they will hunt you relentlessly, and your visions could be cut short. Trust must be earned carefully, for you must decide who will stand by your side and who may betray you. The villagers look to you for guidance, but you cannot reveal your full hand — lest the shadows find a way to silence you. With cunning and courage, you must share your insights subtly, steering the daily debates to expose those with sinister intent. As you navigate this perilous game, remember: knowledge is your weapon, but discretion is your shield. Only you hold the key to breaking the curse on Millers Hollow. Use it wisely, for each night brings you closer to victory — or to danger. The path is dark, Seer. But your light may yet guide the village to safety. Good luck."
