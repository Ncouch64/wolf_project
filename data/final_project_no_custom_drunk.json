        "Emily:  I understand the need for evidence, but sometimes actions speak louder than words. Let's keep a close eye on how everyone behaves today.",

You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
