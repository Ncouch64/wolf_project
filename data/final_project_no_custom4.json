        "Sophia: I think we need to consider who had the most to gain from Bob's death. Let's not forget that the werewolves are among us, lurking in the shadows, pretending to be innocent villagers. It's crucial we find them before they strike again.",
        "Victoria:  I suggest we focus on anyone who seemed too eager to point fingers or divert attention away from themselves yesterday. The werewolves are cunning, they won't hesitate to throw suspicion on others to save themselves. Let's stay vigilant.",
        "Kyle:   You're right, Victoria. We can't let the werewolves manipulate the situation. Let's look closely at anyone trying too hard to act innocent.",
        "Emily:  \n I agree with you all. It's essential we analyze everyone's behavior and statements from yesterday to uncover any inconsistencies or suspicious actions. Let's not overlook any subtle clues that might lead us to the werewolves.",
        "Thomas: I think we should focus on observing who has been overly quiet or passive during our discussions. The werewolves might try to blend in by staying under the radar. Let's not underestimate the power of silence in this game.",
        "Kyle:   I agree with Thomas. The silent ones may be trying to avoid detection by staying low-key. Let's keep a keen eye on those who are too quiet.",
        "Thomas:  \n\nI concur with Kyle. It's crucial to pay attention to those who choose to remain in the shadows, as their silence could be a tactic to avoid suspicion. Let's keep a watchful gaze on the quieter villagers.",
        "Victoria:  I have my eyes on those who are too quick to agree without offering much insight or analysis. Let's not overlook anyone, even those who appear agreeable on the surface. Let's dig deeper.",
        "Kyle:  I think we shouldn't discount anyone, even those who seem overly agreeable. It's important to consider all angles and behaviors before making any hasty decisions. Let's not overlook any potential threats.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nBenjamin: I've been listening to all of you, and I can't help but notice the emphasis on suspicious behaviors. However, I believe we should also pay attention to those who are trying a bit too hard to blend in and appear innocent. The real werewolf might be hiding in plain sight, camouflaged among the crowd. Let's not overlook the master of deception in our midst.",
        "Emily:  \n Benjamin brings up an excellent point. Let's not only focus on the suspicious ones but also be wary of those going the extra mile to seem blameless. The werewolves could be using subtle tactics to evade detection, so we must be vigilant.",
        "Thomas:  \n\nBenjamin raises a valid concern. We must not only scrutinize the suspicious but also be cautious of those going above and beyond to appear innocent. The wolves may be hiding behind a veil of false virtue, so let's not overlook the wolves in sheep's clothing among us.",
        "Benjamin announces: I have discovered that Sophia is a werewolf.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

I'll try to subtly steer the conversation towards analyzing their behavior without drawing too much attention to myself.] \n\nI concur with Kyle.
