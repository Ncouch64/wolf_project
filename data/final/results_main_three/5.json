        "ivy:   It's indeed a tragedy, Bob's demise. I couldn't help but notice eve's absence during the night. Perhaps they have more to hide than meets the eye. What say you, eve? Where were you when the Werewolf struck?",
        "eve:   I was in my own home, minding my own business, as any innocent villager would be. We should focus on finding the real culprit, not pointing fingers without evidence.",
        "jack:  Ah, Ivy, trying to deflect attention, are we? Very clever. But let's not overlook your eagerness to accuse Eve without any solid proof. Suspicious, don't you think? Perhaps you have something to hide yourself.",
        "ivy:   I'm simply stating facts, Jack. It's natural to question those who were not present during such a crucial moment. I merely seek the truth for the safety of our village. Are you suggesting I'm the one to blame?",
        "ivy:  It's curious how quickly accusations fly, especially from one who seems overly defensive. Let's not lose sight of the real threat here. What about you, Jack? Where were you when Bob met his end?",
        "ivy:  It's intriguing how Jack is quick to shift focus away from himself. Are you trying to hide something, Jack? Your deflection speaks volumes. We must carefully consider all possibilities before making a decision.",
        "jack:  My dear Ivy, always so eager to point fingers. It's easy to cast doubt when you have no evidence. I was in my own home, like everyone else, sound asleep. The real question is, why are you so insistent on shifting blame onto others?",
        "eve:  It's interesting to see the tension rise between Jack and Ivy. They both seem to be deflecting from themselves. I should observe and gather more clues before making a decision. ",
        "ivy:  Actions speak louder than words, Jack. Your words may sound convincing, but actions reveal the truth. Let's not forget the silence of the Werewolves among us. Eve, perhaps you're observing too closely, afraid of getting caught in your own web of deceit.",
        "eve:  Observing closely is how we uncover the truth in times like these. Let actions speak for themselves, as Ivy rightly pointed out. Let's not be swayed by baseless accusations.",
        "jack:  Ah, Eve, always the watcher, never the actor. Clever strategy, but in a game of survival, action is key. Ivy, on the other hand, is quick to point fingers without solid evidence. Perhaps she's trying to divert attention away from herself. What do you think, Eve? Who do you believe is the real threat among us?",
        "jack: I am sorry, but you must cast your vote now against the person you want to eliminate: Ivy or Eve.",

The villagers breathe a collective sigh of relief as the true threat is eliminated. Well played, Jack. The village is safe for now.",

You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
