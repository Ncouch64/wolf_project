        "Sophia: \n\nSophia: Alright, folks, let's start by sharing any suspicions or strange behavior you might have noticed yesterday. We need to work together to uncover the werewolf. \n\nSophia: I noticed Thomas was quite quiet yesterday. Maybe too quiet. Emily, what do you think? Any thoughts on who might be the werewolf?",
        "Kyle:  \n\nKyle: I agree, Thomas was unusually silent. Emily, do you have any suspicions? \n\nEmily: I'm not sure yet, I want to hear from everyone before making any accusations. Let's not rush to judgment.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nBenjamin: I think we should consider Victoria. She's been awfully quick to point fingers without much evidence. \n\nBenjamin: Let's not forget the werewolf could be trying to blend in by staying quiet too. It's not always the loudest one who's guilty.\n\nVictoria: ",
        "Thomas:  \n\nThomas: Benjamin makes a valid point about Victoria. Accusations without solid evidence can be a sign of deception. Let's keep an eye on her behavior. \n\nThomas: I also find Kyle's agreement with Sophia's suspicion towards me interesting. It could be a ploy to divert attention. \n\nThomas: As for Emily, her cautious approach could be a tactic to appear innocent. We should not discount anyone at this stage.",
        "Victoria: \n\nVictoria: Thomas, Benjamin, it's interesting how you're both quick to point fingers at me. Could it be a strategy to divert attention from yourselves? \n\nVictoria: Let's not forget that the werewolf could be playing mind games, trying to frame innocent villagers. We need to be careful not to fall into their trap.",
        "Kyle:  \n\nKyle: Benjamin brings up good points about Victoria's behavior. It's worth considering her motives. \n\nKyle: Thomas, your observation about my agreement with Sophia is duly noted. But I think we should focus on those who are deflecting attention. \n\nKyle: Emily, what do you make of the accusations flying around? Do you have any suspicions of your own?",
        "Sophia: \n\nSophia: Benjamin and Kyle make valid points about Victoria's behavior. It might be worth revisiting her actions from yesterday. \n\nSophia: Thomas, your alertness to potential diversions is astute. We must be vigilant and not fall prey to manipulation. The werewolf could be using any one of us as a pawn.",
        "Emily: \n\nEmily: Benjamin, your eagerness to accuse Victoria raises some questions. Could it be a ploy to shift blame onto an easy target?\n\nEmily: Thomas, while you raise good points, I sense a hint of deflection in your observations. Let's not lose focus on finding the true culprit.\n\nEmily: Let's not forget that the real werewolf is lurking among us, waiting to strike again. We must act decisively and not be swayed by false accusations.",
        "Kyle:  \n\nKyle: I agree with Emily, deflection is a common tactic. We need to remain focused and not get sidetracked by distractions. \n\nKyle: Let's keep a close eye on Victoria and anyone trying to sow doubt among us. We must act swiftly to protect the village. \n\nKyle: My vote is for Victoria. Her behavior has raised suspicions and we cannot afford to ignore the signs.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nBenjamin: I agree with Kyle. Victoria's actions have been quite suspicious. My vote is also for Victoria. \n\nBenjamin: We must act swiftly to protect our village from the lurking threat. Victoria, the evidence points towards you. \n\nVictoria:",
        "Sophia: \n\nSophia: While the focus is on Victoria, I can't ignore the valid points raised against her. It might be a risk worth taking to eliminate a potential threat.\n\nSophia: However, I must also consider if the accusations against her are genuine or a ploy to divert attention. \n\nSophia: At this moment, my vote goes to Victoria. The evidence against her seems compelling, and the safety of the village is paramount.",
        "Thomas:  \n\nThomas: My visions have shown me the truth. I must reveal that Victoria is indeed the Werewolf among us. \n\nThomas: Trust in my gift, for the darkness will be lifted from our village tonight. Let us stand united against the true threat. \n\nThomas: My vote is for Victoria. The time has come to rid Millers Hollow of the evil that has been hiding in plain sight.",

Let's trust in Thomas's vision and stand united against the true threat.\n\nBenjamin: It is time to make our stand against the darkness. Victoria, your time is up.\n\nNarrator: With a resounding majority, the villagers have spoken. Victoria, revealed to be the Werewolf, meets her fate at the hands of the villagers. The morning sun rises over Millers Hollow once more, but the threat still looms. Night will soon fall again, and the villagers must remain vigilant. As darkness descends, who will be the next target of the Werewolf?",

The true test lies ahead as we navigate the shadows of Millers Hollow.\n\nEmily: Remember, the real threat could be hiding in plain sight, waiting to strike again. Let's stay sharp and work together to protect our village.",

You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
